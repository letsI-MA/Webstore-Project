We had 5 days to plan and execute our vision for the Webshop and our team consisted of 1 Product Owner, 1 'Scrum Master' and 8 Devs.
On our first day we brainstormed ideas, acceptance criteria and definition of done. After that the work began.

### My role was being a Dev and my tasks I chose were the `anfahrt.html`, `input-page.html` and `db_modify.php`

- `anfahrt.html` has a simple iframe from google to plan the route

# Responsive Design

After our acceptance criteria were met, I was responsible for the responsiveness of the entire website.
